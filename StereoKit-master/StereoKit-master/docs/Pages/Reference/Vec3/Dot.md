title: Vec3.Dot
description: The dot product is an extremely useful operation! One major use is to determine how similar two vectors are. If the vectors are Unit vectors (magnitude/length of 1), then the result will be 1 if the vectors are the same, -1 if they're opposite, and a gradient in-between with 0 being perpendicular.
