title: TexFormat.Rgba32
description: Red/Green/Blue/Transparency data channels, at 8 bits per-channel in sRGB color space. This is what you'll want most of the time you're dealing with color images! Matches well with the Color32 struct! If you're storing normals, rough/metal, or anything else, use Rgba32Linear.
