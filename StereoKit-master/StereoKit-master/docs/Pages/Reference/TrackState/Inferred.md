description: The system doesn't know for sure where this is, but it has an educated guess that may be inferred from previous data at a lower quality. For example, a controller may still have accelerometer data after going out of view, which can still be accurate for a short time after losing optical tracking.

## Description
The system doesn't know for sure where this is, but it
has an educated guess that may be inferred from previous data at
a lower quality. For example, a controller may still have
accelerometer data after going out of view, which can still be
accurate for a short time after losing optical tracking.
