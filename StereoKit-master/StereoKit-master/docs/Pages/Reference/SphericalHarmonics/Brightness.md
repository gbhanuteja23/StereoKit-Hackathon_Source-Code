Scales all the SphericalHarmonic's coefficients! This
behaves as if you're modifying the brightness of the lighting
this object represents.

|float scale|A multiplier for the coefficients! A value of             1 will leave everything the same, 0.5 will cut the brightness in             half, and a 2 will double the brightness.|
