		/// just pass that into an empty texture! Here, we're 
		/// building a simple grid texture, like so:
		/// 
		/// ![Procedural Texture]({{site.url}}/img/screenshots/ProceduralTexture.jpg)
		/// 
		/// You can call SetTexture as many times as you like! If 
		/// you're calling it frequently, you may want to keep
		/// the width and height consistent to prevent from creating
		/// new texture objects. Use TexType.ImageNomips to prevent
		/// StereoKit from calculating mip-maps, which can be costly,
		/// especially when done frequently.
		// Create an empty texture! This is TextType.Image, and 
		// an RGBA 32 bit color format.
		Tex gridTex = new Tex();

		// Use point sampling to ensure that the grid lines are
		// crisp and sharp, not blended with the pixels around it.

		// of two are always best for textures, since this makes
