title: MatParamName.NormalTex
description: The 'normal map' texture for the material! This texture contains information about the direction of the material's surface, which is used to calculate lighting, and make surfaces look like they have more detail than they actually do. Normals are in Tangent Coordinate Space, and the RGB values map to XYZ values.  This represents the texture param 'normal'.
