# StereoCraft - A block-building like experience built using StereoKit
This repository contains the source code of the project that we have developed for StereoKit Hackathon organized by Microsoft.

## Inspiration
StereoKit is an Open-Sorce framework so it inspires us to contribute to the Open-Source community that's why we have decided to build something using StereoKit. For our project we have got inspiration from Minecraft in which anything in the gameworld can be created using simple blocks so that's why we have named our project as _**StereoCraft**_ in which anything can be created using cubes. 

## What it does
In our project, one can develop anything that he/she wants with the help of cubes. We have added functionality for **spawning cubes**, **deleting cubes** and **changing the colour of cubes**. 

We were also adding functionality for Rotating, scaling and changing the position of individual cubes but because of lack of time, we weren't able to implement these functionalities fully so have removed them at the last minute. 

## How we built it
We have built this project using StereoKit SDK, Visual Studio IDE and C# programming language. [Documentation of StereoKit](https://stereokit.net/) was quite helpful to get an idea of the components of this SDK. 

## Challenges we ran into
-We were facing issues with the implementation of OpenXR into the project as we haven't found any resources in the Documentation showing how to do that. 

- We were also not able to build and test it on Quest 2 because of not being able to build it for Quest because of the above issue. 

- We are used to developing AR/VR Apps/Games in Unity Engine so in the beginning, it has taken some time to plan the architecture of this App and implement the features that we have thought using StereoKit. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have properly planned and have created an architecture of this App. We were not able to complete it because of lack of time but we will definitely improve this App in future. 

We have implemented functionalities like **spawning cubes**, **deleting cubes** and **changing the colour of cubes**. 

## What we learned
StereoKit SDK, more concepts of C#, project architecture and planning, refactoring code and many more

## What's next for StereoKit Interaction
Adding functionality for rotating, scaling and changing the position of individual cubes and updating the UI of this App.
